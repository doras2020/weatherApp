# weatherApp
Home assignement:

We would like to get the weather forecast for zip code: 20852, which is in
Rockville, MD USA.

In order to do that we will use an api to weather.com (or to any other
weather subscriber) using api from https://rapidapi.com/marketplace.

Please do the following:
1. Create a test plan of what do you plan to test and how
2. Develop the tests using python as language and pytest as testing
framework.

I chose open-weather-map API
